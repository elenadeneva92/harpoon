- file descriptor limits:
  - express as resource like mem/cpu?
  - default to something sane (bazooka: 131072)
  - libcontainer isn't aware of this, so harpoon-container needs to know to call `syscall.Setrlimit` with the appropriate values.
- logging
  - expose logs over API
  - decide if svlogd+udp to agent makes sense for exposing logs in the API;
    alternative could be adapting bazooka-log code
- state
  - agent will not presently recover its internal state on restart
  - some things it needs to recover:
    - next port (can steal this from bazooka, maybe docker)
    - running containers (walk /run/harpoon/$containerid)
    - container configurations (not stored on disk)
- API
  - /containers
  - event stream
  - non-happy path
  - review heartbeat interactions
  - have a way to sync agent.ContainerInstance.Status regularly
- docs
- tests
- refactoring
